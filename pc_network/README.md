Some projects of my Computers Network classes in University (Using Cisco Packet Tracer).
t1 - A network design with 3 VLANÂ´s, 3 Servers and some DHCP machines. Each server have a unique DHCP, HTTP and FTP service, respectively accessed by the machines connected in their VLAN;

router-lucas - A network design with 3 Routers and some other devices. The idea was connect three networks from different places;

IOT-FINAL - Final project of semester (2nd of 2020). The proposal was to build a network design using IOT. My idea was develop a SMART apartament as from a real plant. Each one counts with smarts doors, windows and a integrated anti-fire system. If some smoke is detected, the door is automatically unlocked and all the windows are opened. If a certain level of smoke are detected in AP1, only the SMART equipaments of the AP1 will react. The hall and stairs of each floor are equiped with a SMART moviment-detector. When moviment is detected, the cameras turn on and the lights are activate.
